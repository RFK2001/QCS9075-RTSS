 * Since safetylib modules are running on different OSes and

 * Luckily, C language makes sure the minimum data type size.
 * For instance, short is at least 16 bits long.
 * "int" is at lease 16 bit long in C language. In most cases,
 * "int" is 32 bits long. If not, please add a #define INT_16BIT
